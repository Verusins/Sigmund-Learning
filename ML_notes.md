Artificial Intelligence - A.I.

- A.I. can be _predefined_: e.g. tic-tac-toe / chess
  (It is a bunch of rules been created for the A.I. , could be simple)
  more complex example: e.g. pacman: facing the character and chase

ML is a part of AI,

> **Machine Learning** is _figuring out the rules_ for us, replacing the predefined rules.
> ML Goal: raise accuracy
> Feeding answers to the model instead of rules.
